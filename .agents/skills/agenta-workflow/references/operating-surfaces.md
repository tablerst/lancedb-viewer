# Agenta Operating Surfaces

This file has one purpose: decide whether to use CLI mode or MCP mode.

## Selection Order

Choose the most direct, stable Agenta boundary with the fewest translation layers in the current environment. MCP and CLI are both supported; select one deliberately before writes.

### 1. MCP Mode

Prefer MCP mode if any condition is true:

- Agenta MCP tools are directly available in the current environment.
- The task focuses on tool contracts, schemas, integration compatibility, or host behavior.
- The user explicitly asks to operate through MCP or tools.
- The work is being performed by an Agent Host that can call Agenta tools directly.

After choosing MCP mode, read `mcp-mode.md`.

### 2. CLI Mode

Use CLI mode if any condition is true:

- No more direct Agenta tool boundary is available.
- The task needs local scripting, batch operations, or quick acceptance checks.
- The task needs a stable command sequence that can be repeated.
- The user explicitly asks for command-line operation.
- The environment is binary-only or CLI-first, and `agenta` is available even though MCP tools are not.

After choosing CLI mode, read `cli-mode.md`.

### 3. Blocked

Stop and report an installation/configuration issue if neither condition is true:

- Agenta MCP tools are available.
- The `agenta` CLI is available and allowed in the current workspace.

## Avoid

- Do not default to CLI only for consistency.
- Do not hand-build shell commands when MCP tools are already available and appropriate.
- Do not treat the invocation surface as the goal. The goal is to organize projects, versions, tasks, notes, and state correctly.
- Do not switch between MCP and CLI during a write sequence without explaining why and reading back state after the switch.

## Always Read

After selecting a mode, read `common-workflow.md`, then load only the targeted references it names for the current scenario.
